# Johan Joensson's Corne's Keymap
_This keymap started as a copy of the [splitkb Aurora Corne default keymap](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/splitkb/aurora/corne/keymaps/default)._

A simple keymap for the Aurora Corne
============================================

This is my Corne keyboard layout, there are many like it, but this one is mine.

What do all these layers do?
----------------------------

### Layer 0: Base layer

This is where your basic letters live.

Extend thumbs to access the different layers.

* The left thumb finger gives access to the Numbers (or lower) layer
* The right thumb finger gives access to the Symbols (or raise) layer
* Extending both thumb fingers gives access to the Adjust layer

### Layer 1: Lower

The Lower layer gives access to your number keys on the top row. It also exposes the arrow keys in the usual Vim-style layout.

### Layer 2: Raise

The Raise layer gives access to the symbols. In addition to shifted number keys on the top row, the right hand also exposes the remaining symbol keys, both as shifted and non-shifted variants.

### Layer 3: Numpad

The Numpad layer gives access to a numpad like layout on the right hand.
